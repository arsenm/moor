A C++ wrapper for LibArchive
----------------------------

It's not easy to compress multiple files and create 
archives (tar, zip, 7z, ...) in c++.
It's even harder when you need to compress on memory.

This project is a wrapper for the wonderfull 
[LibArchive](http://libarchive.github.com/)
library.
